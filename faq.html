title: Pretzel
description: A Smart, contextual shortcut finder that helps you speed up daily tasks. Never need to find that shortcut again
css: pretzel
social-image: ''
questions:
  - q: Why does it call Pretzel?
    a: Because the only shortcut symbol I could ever remember is the command key, which is also called "Pretzel" key.
  - q: There are so many shortcut apps out there, why did you make another one?
    a: I was frustrated by not being able to press a button and see all the shortcuts of my currently using app. The closest I found and loved was CheatSheet, but since I still have some minor complaints about it (such as not being able to see all the shortcuts of Adobe apps) so decided to make my own.
  - q: What is the next step for Pretzel?
    a: One thing I have in mind is to be able to execute the command on click. Feel free to email/twitter DM me if you have any suggestion.
